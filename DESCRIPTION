Description: Provide the p-value of the test statistic for high-dimensional relevant difference in the generalized linear regression models and its application to transfer learning. In the paper Liu(2024), we propose novel statistics to test relevant difference of two high-dimensional coefficients in the generalized linear regression models. The proposed method can serve as a means for high-dimensional transfer learning the generalized linear regression models.
